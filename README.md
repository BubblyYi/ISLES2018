# ISLES2018
Keras implementation of U-shaped Deep Convolution Neural Network for image segmentation.

The code was written to be trained using the ISLES2018 data set for brain lesion segmentation, but it can be easily modified to be used in other 3D applications. The code was derived form the repository 3D U-Net Convolution Neural Network with Keras created by ellisdg: https://github.com/ellisdg/3DUnetCNN.

For more information about models and trining please refer to paper: The code was written to be trained using the BRATS data set for brain tumors, but it can be easily modified to be used in other 3D applications.
